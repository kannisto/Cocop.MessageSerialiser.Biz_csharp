To generate proxy classes from XML schemata, you can do the following.


1) Download the B2MML XML schema files (V0600) to your computer. These are available at http://www.mesa.org/en/B2MML.asp

If the files are compressed in a Zip file, extract the required *.xsd files.


2) Add an extension for scheduling parameters in the ProductionRequest type. In file "B2MML-V0600-Extensions.xsd", find the group "ProductionRequest" and edit is as follows.

<xsd:group name = "ProductionRequest">
  <xsd:sequence>
    <!-- add extended elements here -->
    <xsd:element name="SchedulingParameters">
    </xsd:element>
  </xsd:sequence>
</xsd:group>

This extension enables scheduling parameters of any type to reside in a production request.


3) Move the schemata into C:\temp\_codegen_b2mml\b2mml. Also move "parameters.xml" in C:\temp.

The expected folder structure is in the file "parameters.xml", as you will later use this parameter file as a an argument in proxy generation.


4) In the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio, use the following command:

xsd C:\temp\_codegen_b2mml\b2mml\AllSchemas.xsd /c /parameters:parameters.xml > xsdout.txt /o:xsd_cs_out

The command should include all necessary XML schemata and generate to required proxies in the "xsd_cs_out" folder.

As the API was developed, the version of 'xsd.exe' was 4.6.1055.0.


5) Add the proxy file (.cs) to MessageSerialiserBiz project in the Visual Studio solution.
